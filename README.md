# electrontagger is an basketball video tagging application written in electron. 

I am a basketball coach and an engineer , I was using Instat to watch games and understand more about basketball , but after Hudle bought Instat , unfortunately the price of the application went rocket high for a hobby coach like me. 

So i started developing a small application , so coaches can use on their own.
